Elevator Project Management Software

Database (Version 1)
This report is to discuss how the database should be implemented for this project. We
use SQL based database for this project. And Thakee is assigned to do this part of this
project.

What should be there in the database deliverable end of first Sprint.

	Supplier(s) â€“ Can be one or more suppliers.
	Date
	Is project accepted (Bool)
	Date of acceptance
	Estimated time of completion
	(Some More, I will specify on V2 of the document may be)

Technical Sheet
	Technical Sheet ID (Most of the time there will be only one technical sheet for a project, But keeping space for multiple technical sheets and revised sheets would be an added feature.)
	Initial edit date, time
	Last edit date, time
	(Default columns for technical sheet, Since not properly specified by our client I will specify them in the next version of the report.)
	Others (An added feature to add extra fields of information which are not in default technical sheet, Expected to store as JSON in SQL table.)

I will add other details on another version of this report in the next sprint.
